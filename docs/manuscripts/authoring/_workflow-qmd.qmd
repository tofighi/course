The basic workflow for writing a manuscript in Quarto is to make changes to your article content in `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}`, preview the changes with Quarto, and repeat. Let's try it out.

Open `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}`. 

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_vscode"}
Preview the manuscript by hitting the **Preview** button located in the menu bar of the editor:

:::

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_rstudio"}
Render and preview the manuscript by hitting the **Render** button located in the menu bar of the editor:

:::

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_vscode"}
You'll see some output from Quarto in the Terminal and then a live preview will appear in a new Quarto Preview pane.
:::

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_rstudio"}
You'll see some output from Quarto in the Background Jobs pane and then a live preview will appear in the Viewer pane.
:::

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_rstudio"}
![](images/rstudio-preview.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the RStudio IDE. Open in the Source pane is a file called index.qmd. In the Viewer pane, a website starting with the header La Palma Earthquakes."}

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_vscode"}

You'll dive into the details of this `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}` next, but for now let's make a change and see what happens.

Find the line:

``` yaml
title: La Palma Earthquakes
```

Change the line to:

``` yaml
title: La Palma Earthquake Mechanisms
```

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_rstudio"}
Save the notebook, re-render, and you'll see the preview update.

:::

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_vscode"}
Save the notebook, hit Preview, and you'll see the preview update.

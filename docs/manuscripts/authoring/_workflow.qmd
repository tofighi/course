The basic workflow for writing a manuscript in Quarto is to make changes to your article content in `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}`, preview the changes with Quarto, and repeat. Let's try it out.

Open a new Terminal in {{< meta tool.name >}} and run:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto preview
```

You'll see some output from Quarto on the Terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
$ quarto preview
Preparing to preview
[1/1] {{< meta tool.article-file >}}

Watching files for changes
Browse at http://localhost:3806/
GET: /
```

And then, a browser window will open with a live preview of the manuscript.

You may find it helpful to move and resize your windows so that {{< meta tool.name >}} and the live preview are side by side.

The contents of the article is generated by `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}`. Go ahead and open this file in {{< meta tool.name >}}.

You'll dive into the details of this file next, but for now let's make a change and see what happens.

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_jupyterlab"}
The first cell (starting with "La Palma Earthquakes") is a Markdown cell, enter Edit mode in this cell, and find the line:
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-meta="tool.is_jupyterlab"}
Find the line:
:::

``` yaml
title: La Palma Earthquakes
```

Change the line to:

``` yaml
title: La Palma Earthquake Mechanisms
```

Save the notebook, and you'll see the preview update automatically.

If you close the preview accidentally, you can navigate to it again by using the URL from the output in the Terminal, e.g. `http://localhost:3806/`. If you want to stop the preview, hit Crtl + C in the Terminal. You can start the preview again by running `quarto preview`.

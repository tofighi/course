## Install Quarto First

If you haven't already, make sure you've installed the pre-release version of Quarto, as described in the [Manuscript Overview](../index.qmd#install).

### Install the Jupyter Lab Quarto Extension

::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_vscode"}
### Install the Quarto VS Code Extension

Install the Quarto extension from the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) or the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quarto/quarto).

### Install Python Packages

The template manuscript includes some executable Python code. To render Python code you'll need `jupyter` along with the packages specific to this code, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
python3 -m pip install jupyter matplotlib pandas 
```

Alternatively, once you have the template repo below, you can use the file `requirements.txt` to get the packages you need.

### Clone the Template Repository {#clone-repo}

To follow this tutorial you'll need your own copy of the [template repository]({{< meta tool.template-repo >}}), including all of its branches.

1.  Head to [GitHub to create a new repository from the template]({{< meta tool.template-repo >}}/generate).

    Provide a **Repository Name** and make sure you check **Include all branches**. Then **Create repository from template**. ![](images/github-create-from-template.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of GitHub's create a new repo from a template page. Repository name has been filled with manuscript-template, and the box labelled Include all branches is checked."}

2.  Once your repository is created, clone it to your local computer.

    ::: {.content-visible unless-meta="tool.is_rstudio"}
    You can do this any way you are comfortable, for instance in the Terminal, it might look like:

    ``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
    git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repo-name>.git
    ```

    Where you use your own user name and repo name.
    :::

    ::: {.content-visible when-meta="tool.is_rstudio"}
    You can do this any way you are comfortable, but one approach is to use **File** > **New Project**. In the **New Project** dialog, select **From Version Control**, then **Git**, and copy and paste the repo URL from GitHub.

3.  You'll be working inside this directory throughout the tutorial, so if you are ready to proceed, navigate inside the directory, and start Jupyter Lab:

    ``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
    cd manuscript-tutorial
    python3 -m jupyter lab
    ```

3.  You'll be working inside this directory throughout the tutorial, so if you are ready to proceed, open the directory in VS Code.

### Late Assignment Submission

This policy outlines the guidelines and penalties for assignment submissions, including late submission penalties, accommodations for students with special needs, and the process for requesting deadline extensions due to medical or reasonable issues.

#### General Late Submission Policy

Late submissions are subject to the following penalties, as outlined in the table below:

| **Late Submission Period**              | **Penalty**                                               |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Up to 24 hours after the deadline       | 10% deduction from the total score                      |
| Up to 48 hours after the deadline       | 20% deduction from the total score                      |
| Up to 72 hours after the deadline       | 30% deduction from the total score                      |
| More than 72 hours after the deadline   | Grade of 0 will be assigned                             |

- Submissions through any method other than the designated course shell assignment folder will **not** be evaluated or graded.

#### Students With Accommodation Letters

Students with documented accommodation letters are eligible for an **additional 72-hour extension** for all assignments and projects. However:

- No further extensions or grace periods are allowed beyond the extended deadline.
- Submissions made after this extended deadline will receive a grade of 0.

#### Deadline Extensions for Medical or Reasonable Issues

In cases where medical or reasonable issues prevent meeting a deadline, students must follow these procedures:

1. Submit relevant documentation (e.g., medical certificates or other supporting documents) to the instructor or department.
2. The instructor or department will review the documentation and decide whether to grant an extension.
3. Extensions will **not** be granted at the time of the request but will be considered during the grading process.
4. Approval of extension requests is at the sole discretion of the instructor or department. 
   - Providing documentation does not guarantee approval.
   - Students are advised to plan for the possibility of the extension request being denied and aim to submit assignments on time.

#### Deadline Extension Announcements

Extensions to deadlines will only occur if formally announced on the course announcements platform. Students should monitor these announcements regularly for updates.

#### Conclusion

All students are required to follow the submission deadlines and adhere to the late submission penalties outlined in this policy. Students with accommodations or legitimate medical/reasonable issues must follow the procedures detailed above and provide the required documentation. Extension decisions will be made objectively to ensure fairness and consistency.

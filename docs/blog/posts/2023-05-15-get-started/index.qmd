Have you been hearing about Quarto but didn't give it a try yet? Perused the [Get Started](/docs/get-started/) pages but would like another intro? Or have about 20 minutes to spare and want to pick up a few Quarto tips? You've come to the right place!

{{< video "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_f3latmOhew" >}}

In this video, I walk you through creating documents, presentations, and websites and publishing with Quarto. The video features authoring Quarto documents with executable R code chunks using the [RStudio Visual Editor](/docs/visual-editor/).

Select highlights include:

-   Inserting [cross references](/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) to tables and figures
-   Adding a [citation](/docs/visual-editor/technical.html#citations) from a DOI
-   Seamlessly switching between output formats as well as creating [multi-format documents](/docs/output-formats/html-multi-format.html)
-   Customizing the [output location](/docs/presentations/revealjs/#output-location) of code in presentations
-   Creating a [website](/docs/websites/) from scratch
-   Publishing the website to [QuartoPub](/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html)

If you would like to follow along as you watch the video, you can find the source code for everything created in the video in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/get-started-quarto) and the published [website on QuartoPub](https://mine.quarto.pub/welcome-to-quarto/).

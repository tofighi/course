## Overview

Quarto Dashboards use same Bootstrap 5 based theming system as regular HTML documents (so themes you have built for HTML websites can also be used with dashboards). Use the `theme` option to choose a theme:

``` yaml
theme: cosmo
```

Quarto includes 25 themes from the [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) project (for example, the website uses the [cosmo](https://bootswatch.com/cosmo/) theme). Available themes include:

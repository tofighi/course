If you need help, there's a wonderful online community ready to help you at forums.fast.ai. Before asking a question on the forums, search carefully to see if your question has been answered before. (The forum system won't let you post until you've spent a few minutes on the site reading existing topics.)

Every lesson has a dedicated forum thread---so that's the place to look first to see if your question has already been answered:

## Forum etiquette

1.  If you like a post, it's better to "like" it with the :heart: rather than commenting.  It saves traffic in the Forums and makes it easier for everyone to find posts.  
2.  **Please be mindful of looking to see if a topic exists before starting a new thread.**
3. Do a quick **search** of the forums to see if your question is already under discussion.  
4. **Do not @ people if you are not referencing them for a specific reason** that requires the attention of that forum member. Be especially mindful in mentioning Jeremy.
5. You can use this thread to chat about pretty anything (except politics/religion/stuff that might start a flame war!): [General chat](https://forums.fast.ai/t/general-course-chat/95293). For other posts, please keep them to stuff that's at least somewhat related to the course and its content.

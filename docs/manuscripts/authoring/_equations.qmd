Quarto markdown can include equations specified in LaTeX notation. Use single dollar signs (`$`) to add an equation inline or double dollar signs (`$$`) to add a display equation. Both of these are illustrated in the following paragraph in `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}`:

``` markdown
Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.
```
Notice the display equation has a label added in curly braces after the closing `$$`. This allows it to be referenced using `@eq-poisson` in the text.

When rendered, this displays as:

> Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

> p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
> $$ {#eq-poisson}

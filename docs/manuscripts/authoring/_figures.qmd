To include a figure from a file, the markdown syntax looks like:

``` markdown
![Caption](file_path_to_image)
```

For example, to include the `la-palma-map.png` image from the `images/` folder in the project, along with the caption "Map of La Palma", you would write:

``` markdown
![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png)
```

## Image File Location

You don't have to store your images in a folder called `images/`, although it is a common convention. Your images can be anywhere **inside** your manuscript project directory, just make sure you include the full path to the image, relative to the location of `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}`.
:::

The actual markdown in `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}` includes a further attribute, `#fig-map` inside curly braces following the image path to provide a label for cross references:

``` markdown
![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}
```

Another attribute that you may wish to add is `fig-alt`, the alt text to be provided for the image. For example:

``` markdown
![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map fig-alt="A map of the Canary Islands. The second most west island, La Palma, is highlighted."}
```

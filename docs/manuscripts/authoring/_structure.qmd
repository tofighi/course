The file `index.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook. Like any Jupyter Notebook it contains cells that could be raw, markdown or code. There are three features of this notebook that are Quarto specific:

-   The first cell contains a YAML header that is used to set document metadata, including scholarly front matter. This cell must start and end with a line of three dashes (`---`), and within these lines, content is parsed as YAML. You'll notice the cell itself is set to be a Markdown cell; this allows the Quarto Jupyter Lab Extension to visually emulate how some of these options will appear in the rendered document.

-   The other markdown cells use Quarto specific markdown syntax to include things like figures, tables, equations, cross references and citations.

-   Code cells may have special Quarto comments at the top that start with `#|`. These comments set Quarto options that control how the code and its output appear in the article.

The rest of this page walks you through the cells in this article from top to bottom, introducing you to the Quarto features you'll most likely need to write a scholarly article.

The file `index.qmd` is a Quarto markdown file. It contains three types of content:

-   It starts with a YAML header that is used to set document metadata, including scholarly front matter. The YAML header starts and ends with a line of three dashes (`---`), and within these lines, content is parsed as YAML. 

-   It may include executable code chunks which start with three backticks followed by the code language in curly braces (e.g. ` ```{r} ` or ` ```{python} `). These code chunks may include Quarto comments at the top which start with `#|`. These comments set Quarto options that control how the code and its output appear in the article.

-   The rest of the document is interpreted as Quarto specific markdown, which allows you to include things like figures, tables, equations, cross references and citations.

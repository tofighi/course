Quarto has a host of exciting new features in release v1.4 with one of the most anticipated being Quarto Dashboards. In a recent internal presentation, Charles Teague demonstrated the new capabilities and we wanted to share it with community.

Please note that you can use this feature today, but to access it you need to be running on a recent [Quarto prerelease build](https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html). We also encourage users to review our [pre-release documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/) which offers additional information and examples of the dashboard functionality.

At its simplest, a Quarto manuscript project has two files:

-   A notebook file where you write your article: `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}`. This file contains:
    -   document metadata, including article front matter (authors, affiliations, etc.) and Quarto options,
    -   the article body, written using special Quarto markdown syntax that allows you to add things like cross references and citations, and
    -   optionally, code, where you control if, or how, the code and its output appear in the article.
-   A configuration file `_quarto.yml` that identifies the project as a Quarto manuscript and controls how your manuscript is put together.

This particular manuscript project includes some other files and folders, you'll learn about these files as you work through this tutorial.

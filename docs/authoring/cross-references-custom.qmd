## Overview

You can define custom cross-reference types using the `custom` key to the `crossref` option either in your document or project metadata. At a minimum, a custom type needs:

- `kind`, which currently can only be `float`
- `key`, the abbreviation used in the reference identifier ("In `@fig-1`, ...")
- `reference-prefix`, used for the reference in output ("In Figure 1, ...")
- `caption-prefix`, used in front of the caption text ("Figure 1: ..."). If `caption-prefix` is unspecified, Quarto will use the value of `reference-prefix`.

For example, the following YAML defines a new cross-reference type for videos:

``` yaml
crossref:
  custom:
    - kind: float
      reference-prefix: Video
      key: vid
```

You can then use this new type with the [Cross-Reference Div Syntax](cross-references-divs.qmd) in a document:

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
::: {#vid-cern}

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/wo9vZccmqwc >}}

"CERN: The Journey of Discovery"

:::

In @vid-cern...
```

Which renders as:

::: {#vid-cern}
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/wo9vZccmqwc >}}

"CERN: The Journey of Discovery"
:::

In @vid-cern...

## PDF Output

If your output format is PDF you'll also need to specify `latex-env`, a name to be used for the float environment wrapped around the element in the intermediate TeX. For example, to use the custom video reference type in PDF you could add `latex-env: video`:

``` yaml
crossref:
  custom:
    - kind: float
      reference-prefix: Video
      key: vid
      latex-env: video
```

You can add a listing of your custom cross-references to your document by including a raw LaTeX `\listof` command. The name of the command is `listof` followed by the value of `latex-env` value, followed by an `s`. For example, for the custom video type above, where the `latex-env` was `video`, the command is `\listofvideos{}`:

``` yaml
---
crossref:
  custom:
    - kind: float
      reference-prefix: Video
      key: vid
---

\listofvideos{}

```

By default, the title of the listing is constructed from the `reference-prefix` value. You can specify something else with the `latex-list-of-description` value.

## Example: Supplemental Figures

As another example of a custom cross-reference type consider a document with supplemental figures. For instance, you might require: 

-   Supplemental figures have their own counter, distinct from that of figures.
-   Supplemental figures have labels that look like "Figure S1", "Figure S2" etc.
-   Supplemental figures appear in their own "List of Supplementary Figures" listing.

You could define this supplemental figure type with the following:

```yaml
crossref:
  custom:
    - kind: float
      key: suppfig
      latex-env: suppfig
      reference-prefix: Figure S
      space-before-numbering: false
      latex-list-of-description: Supplementary Figure
```

Note the use of `space-before-numbering: false`, which prevents a space between the `reference-prefix` or `caption-prefix` and the counter, so that labels will appear as "Figure S1", "Figure S2" etc.

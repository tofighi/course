## Custom Themes

You can naturally also create an entirely custom theme and provide only that (in this case you will inherit from the default Bootstrap theme):

``` yaml
theme: custom.scss
```

For example, here are the theme files for the 25 built-in Bootswatch themes:

<https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/themes>

You can read more about the custom theming design [here](/docs/output-formats/html-themes-more.qmd).

## Article Citation

This section describes adding citations in the text of your article. The citation for your own article that is displayed at the bottom of the article webpage is controlled using [Front Matter](#front-matter).

:::

To add citations you need a bibliography file, `.bib`, containing the citation data. You can specify this file in the document YAML with the `bibliography` option. For example, the citation data for `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}` is stored in `references.bib`:

```yaml
bibliography: references.bib
```

The file `references.bib` contains only one citation:

```{.bib filename="references.bib"}
@article{marrero2019,
  author = {Marrero, Jos{\' e} and Garc{\' i}a, Alicia and Berrocoso, Manuel and Llinares, {\' A}ngeles and Rodr{\' i}guez-Losada, Antonio and Ortiz, R.},
  journal = {Journal of Applied Volcanology},
  year = {2019},
  month = {7},
  pages = {},
  title = {Strategies for the development of volcanic hazard maps in monogenetic volcanic fields: the example of {La} {Palma} ({Canary} {Islands})},
  volume = {8},
  doi = {10.1186/s13617-019-0085-5},
}
```

To cite an article from the bibliography in your text, you use `@` followed by the citation identifier, e.g. `marrero2019`. For example, the article includes this line citing this reference: 

```markdown
Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed ...
```

This renders as:

> Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as Marrero et al. (2019), have proposed ...

Hovering over the citation text reveals the full reference details. Clicking on the citation takes a reader to the reference in the References section at the end of the article:

![](images/article-references.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the rendered article showing a section titled References. Below the title is a full reference starting 'Marrero, JosÃ©, '." .border}



The above citation is an example where the author's names are incorporated into the sentence itself. Another common style is to place the citation within parentheses, often at the end of a sentence. You can achieve this by enclosing the citation syntax in square brackets `[`. For example,

```markdown
A prior study of the magma systems feeding the volcano proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano [@marrero2019].
```

This renders as:

> A prior study of the magma systems feeding the volcano proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano (Marrero et al. 2019).

There are many other syntax variations to include page numbers, chapters, or exclude the author names. You can read more in the [Citations & Footnotes](/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) documentation.

The Visual Editor **Insert -> Citation** dialog has utilities for adding citations from their DOI, your Zotero library, and public databases like Crossref, PubMed and DataCite. This provides an easy way to build the  bibliography file (`.bib`) and generate the markdown citation syntax.

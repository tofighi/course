Tables can be added inline with what is known as pipe syntax. As an example, in `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}` a table of earthquakes is specified as:

```markdown
| Name                 | Year   |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| Current              | 2021   |
| Teneguía             | 1971   |
| Nambroque            | 1949   |
| El Charco            | 1712   |
| Volcán San Antonio   | 1677   |
| Volcán San Martin    | 1646   |
| Tajuya near El Paso  | 1585   |
| Montaña Quemada      | 1492   |

: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}
```

Columns are separated by pipes (`|`), and the dashes (`-`) in the second row separate the header row from the rest of the table. A caption can be provided with a line starting with `:`. A label that can be used for cross references is added at the end of the caption inside curly braces. Like figures, the label prefix `tbl-` is required for cross references, but the suffix is up to you.

Inserting and editing tables using markdown syntax can be cumbersome. 
The Visual Editor provides tools for editing existing tables, and inserting new tables. Use the Table menu in the visual editor toolbar or right-click inside a table to bring up the options.
